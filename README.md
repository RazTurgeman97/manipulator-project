# ROS2 Manipulator Project üöÄ

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing projects and exercises from the Udemy course [*"Learn ROS 2 by Building a Real Robot"*](https://www.udemy.com/course/robotics-and-ros-2-learn-by-doing-manipulators). This course adopts a *Learn by Doing* approach, blending theory, practical applications, and hands-on experiments with both simulated and real robots.

## üìπ **Robot in Action**

Here are two examples demonstrating the robot's voice-activated functionality with Alexa:

1. **Activate Robot Command:**

   When the command "Activate Robot" is given, the robot is triggered to start its operation.

2. **Pick Up Command:**

   The "Pick Up" command instructs the robot to pick up an object, showcasing its interaction and movement.

## üß† **Course Highlights**

- **Create a Real Robot**: Build and program a robot from scratch using ROS 2.
- **Digital Twin**: Simulate the robot using URDF, Gazebo, and RViz2.
- **Robot Control**: Implement actuators control with `ros2_control`.
- **Trajectory Planning**: Explore kinematics and trajectory planning with MoveIt 2.
- **Voice Interaction**: Use Alexa to actuate the robot.
- **Arduino Integration**: Interface with hardware using Arduino and serial communication.

The projects are implemented in both Python and C++, enabling flexibility and deep learning across multiple programming paradigms.
